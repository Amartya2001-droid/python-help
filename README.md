Help to execute code.... so basically am like looking to input a random number from the user and will guess a number randomly generated by the computer... any help would be appreciated
The following is the code





from random import randrange
x=randrange(10)
totalguess=0;
y=int(input("Please think of a number"))
while(y==x):
    if y==x :
        print("Wow, you're correct")
        break
    elif y>x :
        print("Nope, too high")
        break
    elif y<x :
        print("Nope, too low")
        break
   print("Please try again")
   y=input()
